Sphinx is a powerful documentation generator primarily
 used for creating professional-quality technical
  documentation. It was originally developed for 
  documenting Python projects but has since evolved to
   support a wide range of programming languages and 
   formats


##
pip install sphinx
sphinx-quickstart
This creates a docs/ directory with necessary files (conf.py, index.rst, etc.).



## Build the HTML documentation
