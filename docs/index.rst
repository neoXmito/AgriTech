My Machine Learning Project
===========================

This project aims to build a flower classification model using deep learning techniques.

Project Overview
----------------
In this project, we utilize deep learning algorithms with TensorFlow and Keras to classify various types of flowers from the **Flower102** dataset. The goal is to accurately identify and classify different species of flowers based on their visual features.

Features
--------
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow and Keras
- **Dataset**: **Flower102** - Contains images of 102 different flower species.
- **Model Accuracy**: The trained model achieves an accuracy of 95% on the test set.

Installation
------------
To set up the environment and install the required dependencies for this project, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Project Structure
-----------------
- **data/**: Contains the Flower102 dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for training the classification model and evaluating its performance.
- **models/**: Pre-trained and trained deep learning models.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies used in this project (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas).
- **main.py**: The main script that orchestrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Usage
-----
1. **Preprocess Data**: Run the `data/preprocessing.py` script to preprocess the images and create datasets.
2. **Train Model**: Use the `scripts/train_model.py` script to train the flower classification model using TensorFlow and Keras.
3. **Evaluate Model**: Run `scripts/evaluate_model.py` to evaluate the trained model's performance on the test set.
4. **Results**: Check the accuracy and performance metrics of the trained model in `notebooks/Results.ipynb`.
